# gecooding
Geographic coordinates finder

README
This python script aims to help data scientists finding the geographic coordinates, given a place around the whole globe via the help of Google API called "Geocoding".
Geocoding is converts addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates 
(like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.

Once inserted the API KEY, that you can retrieve on https://developers.google.com/ , and the street, zip code, city etc...you will get as result the latitude
and longitude in the Google Maps format.

Have fun and play around with it!
